 A painter turned coder who fell in love the first time "Hello World"
 printed in the terminal. For me, coding combines the logical
 reasoning of a mathematician, the vision of an eccentric painter, while 
 whittling complexity into simplicity, becoming a work of art. After
 earning my bachelor's degree from a Buddhist University, I went from being a
 painter, to a vagabond, to a nanny, and for a moment almost became a foreign
 language English teacher, but then it happened. Two words changed
 everything. Hello World.
